# CS201-tidycensus-collab

This repository is used as an exercise in github collaboration in its most basic form!

We'll use tidycensus_intro.Rmd as the collaborative activity.

For collaboration:

1. Find a partner.
2. Decide who will be the "Owner" and who will be the "Collaborator."
3. The Owner will fork this repository and then invite the Collaborator.
4. Both O & C will create new projects in R Studio associated with this repository.
5. Both O & C open tidycensus_intro.Rmd. Save a copy with "-yourname."
6. Save, commit, and push!
7. Pull! Did you get a copy of your partner's file?
